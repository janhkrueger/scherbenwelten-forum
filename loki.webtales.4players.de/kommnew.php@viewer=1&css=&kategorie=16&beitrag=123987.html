Ähm ja ob die das dann auf englisch oder deutsch posten is deren Sache.))<br>
<br>
It was dark rainy day where the clouds laid their shadow over the battlefield<br>
Two armies clashed in front of a castle.<br>
The defenders did their best to hold the defense line in front of it, but eventually failed…<br>
‘Fall back to the castle, soldiers!’, their captain  shouted.<br>
<br>
In the meantime the castle lord sat in his throne, his sword in his hands, ready to stand up and fight as soon as the enemy breeches the last defense. The rest of his family has already retreated to regroup with the rest of their army, only he was still there looking out of the window next to his throne, waiting for his enemy’s arrival.<br>
Suddenly the door opened and his captain stormed in.<br>
‘Highlord! They have breached our defense, we won’t be able to hold them back for much longer. You have to flee!’, he shouted.<br>
But the Lord just sat there looking out of the window, not being interested whether they will catch him or not, as if it wouldn’t matter at all.<br>
‘Highlord?!’<br>
‘Retreat…’<br>
‘What?!’<br>
‘I told you to retreat. Use the tunnels and join my son’s troops.’<br>
‘My LORD! You can’t stay here! They will catch you and what then?!’<br>
‘I am to stay here… It is my Lords will… Now go… Should I not come back serve my children as good as you have served me all those years…’<br>
‘Ye..s, My Lord….’<br>
<br>
With these reluctant words his captain turned and ran back to the battlefield where he would gather the rest of the troops and retreat…<br>
A few moments later he was the only one left in castle.<br>
He could already hear the rattling of his foes armors in hallway, but he still just sat there, looking at the dark sky outside of the castle.<br>
Then the door opened again.<br>
Knights stormed the throne room, pointing their weapons at him while surounding him.<br>
Then two of them stepped aside to let their leader, a man in robes, through.<br>
One could easily see the man’s diabolic satisfaction from his smile, while speaking to the Lord in his throne:<br>
‘Well well if it isn’t Dracon Darknight… Or do I have to address you with ‘Highlord’ now?’<br>
‘It dost not matterest how thou art adressest me, vile creature…’<br>
‘Don’t you dare talking to me from above! Consider your situation before you speak, fool.’<br>
‘It is thou who should considerest thy situation... For I am part of a greater plan thou will never understand…And until now, everything went accordingly to my plans…’<br>
‘Well, unfortunately I have to set an end to your plans…  Get him Knights!’<br>
Suddenly the Lord stood up and  took a battle position.<br>
The Knights stepped back, knowing his yearlong experience in battle, and respecting it at the same time. But their leader was not happy about his troops reluctance and repeated his order angrily: ’I told you to take him into custody, you fools!’<br>
Suddenly Dracon started to laugh.<br>
Everyone was looking at him, thinking that he is outnumbered and therefore in no position to think that the situation is funny. – They even beleieved that he has gone mad.<br>
‘What is so funny?!’, the Knights leader shouted.<br>
‘Art thou not fighting thyself? Art thou hidest behind thy troops like the coward  thou art?’, the Hightlord  said, ‘A Man like thou art not frightenest me, for you are nothing more than a coward, but lo, even thy troops are starting to question thy courage’<br>
‘Enough! GET HIM!’<br>
The troops looked at each other, but eventually decided to follow their leader’s orders.<br>
‘Yes, My Lord!’, the shouted in union.<br>
Dracon closed his eyes and smiled: ‘Just as planned...’, he muttered before he looked up and started shouting at them, ‘Well, bring it on!’<br>
With these words he engaged them battle, knowing that it might be his end...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
‘Father...Father....FATHER!’, a girl yelled.<br>
The cardinal opened his eyes and looked around. He was in great hall of Urvan’s convent and two of his children stood before him.<br>
‘Seraphina... Tanathos, what are you doing here? Why did you have to wake me up...?’<br>
‘We were waiting for you father, so we came see if everything is alright... You don’t look very healthy lately...’, his daughter said in a concerned voice.<br>
‘The voting?’<br>
‘Already over, father... They are gone...’, his son informed him.<br>
‘Indeed... They are...  Well it is the lords will. We are not allowed to question it.<br>
Let’s go home you two. I’m sure your mother and your sisters are waiting for us...’<br>
They nodded their heads and helped their father up with concerned looks. <br>
Both of them knew that he was not feeling well lately and their stepmother told them that he should actually be fine instead of this sick.<br>
As they were leaving the convent halls a knight in a golden armor suddenly called out for them: ‘Your Eminence!’<br>
They turned around and waited for the knight to get close enough.<br>
‘What is it, Captain? Shouldn’t you be with your subordinates to attack one of those heretics?’<br>
‘Well, Your Eminence. You haven’t told me who is to be attacked...’<br>
 ‘Can’t you do that yourself? You are the Temple Knights Captain, not me’<br>
‘But Your Eminence, you’ve ever told us where to attack...’<br>
‘I won’t be there to tell you forever Captain... You should have a list with all the heretics yourself. Just choose one and show them what it means to make our god their enemy...’<br>
‘Just tell him, cardinal Darknight, it is part of your duty as a cardinal, isn’t it?’, a man suddenly said.<br>
Dracon smiled and looked at the man who approached them from behind.<br>
‘Inquisitor... Nice to see you... Well of course I will fulfill my duties. I just thought that the Captain should do it himself at least once...’<br>
‘Well you have your orders, cardinal.’<br>
Dracon turned back to the captain and took out a list.<br>
‘Well let’s see... Most of the current heretics are Minotaurs... Ahh excellent... The demon evocator... he should be a good target for today.’<br>
‘Understood, Your Eminence. I’m on my way.’ the captain said and moved away.<br>
<br>
The Inquisitor smiled and said happily: ‘I see that you know your place Darknight... Good for you. Say, how is your health doing? People say that you are not looking good lately.’<br>
 ‘I appreciate your concerns, but I’m fine. I will properly live another 48 years...’<br>
‘Father...’, his daughter interrupted.<br>
‘Of course... I’m sorry, Inquisitor, but I have to go back to the battlefield. Ultimately, the Minotaurs won’t wait for me, won’t they?<br>
‘Of course cardinal... Have a nice day and bring honor for our god.’<br>
‘Certainly, Inquisitor... Tanathos, Seraphina go ahead and ready our horses. Tell the others to gather all the supplies they need. We will march out at the 13th hour this day.’<br>
‘Yes, father...’, they replied and went ahead.<br>
The inquisitor nodded satisfied, and went away to prepare everything for the next excommunication. <br>
Again he was alone and looked back at the statue of his god and mumbled: ‘I understood your will, My Lord… And I will carry it out, no matter the odds…’<br>
As he left the yard he was again approached by the Temple Knights’ captain.<br>
‘Your Eminence. May I have a word with you?’<br>
‘I believe that you have already received your orders.’<br>
‘It is about high priestess Pelogran.’<br>
‘About MISS Pelogran, Captain. She no longer is a high priestess.’<br>
‘Your Eminence, please excuse my profanity, but are you really going to let that slide?!’<br>
‘What is it I’m letting slide? It is our Lords will, Otherwise the voting’s result would have been different.’<br>
‘But...!’<br>
‘Listen up, Captain’, he said angrily, ‘You might be the Temple Knights’ captain, but you have no right to question our gods will! So you can either go and fulfill your duty now or I will have to report you to the Inquisitor. Did you understand that?’<br>
‘Yes...Your Eminence… I’ll be there in no time…’<br>
The Captain walked away, dissatisfied with the cardinals decision.<br>
Dracon sighted: ‘He really doesn’t know what’s good for him…’<br>
Then he walked away himself. to join his comrades for the upcoming battle… <br>

<br>
<br>
The man starred at the sword in his hand. It had a strange shape as if it was made by a drunken and mad smith with paranoid complexes.<br>
<br>
Two small spikes started beneath the blade forming a triangel. Tiny little spikes beeing sharp enough to cut and sting through flesh and bones as if they were air.<br>
<br>
Annother two blades &quot;protected&quot; the hand of its yielder and a bar made of solid steel was the third guard of this sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;Drugar, please come ...&quot;.<br>
<br>
Drugar didn´t respond. Those people had choosen him as their leader, but he was just annoyed of beeing in charge. Peasants should not go on war, this was the work, NO! the duty, of a knight - to protect the innocent, to fight injustice.<br>
<br>
His decisions could lead many good man to a painful death. The worst thing was, that they were his friends. Not like these faceless enemy soldiers, that could be replaced like parts of a machinery. <br>
<br>
He was annoyed that he cared for his men, while other leaders treated their soldiers as if they were animals. <br>
<br>
He was annoyed because he didn´t want this responsibility, while others would simply and mindless misuse the power of such a position.<br>
<br>
Once an old wise man told him, that a good leader never asks for power, instead sacrifices himself for the well beeing of his man. He nodded ...<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, I´ll be there ... lets kick some snob asses ...&quot;<br>
<br>
Finally Drugar defended his village against a number of vile foes - traitorous knights. He rallied and united the villagers to team up and fight a hopeless war, against heavy armored and much better equipped enemies. Many of his friends and neighbours died during this onslaught, but finally the poor peasants won, outnumbering their arrogant enemies.<br>
<br>
<br>
When the battle was over he swore by the dwarish sword Tyrfing, that he would never lift it again. And he swore to the gods that he would raise his children in the religion and mind of god Tyr, god of justice, god of war.<br>
<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Fight and work for others, not for thyself. Be humble, but the mos´ importan´ ting´ be honest, say what thou think.&quot;<br>
<br>
His father was long dead, killed by a drunken neighbour, but his will to fight injustice, will be staying in the heart of his son for eternity. <br>
<br>
Maybe this might help him, in the hard times that are about to come. <br><br><b>Sir  Heindal</b>,<br>Vorsteher von Reinga,<br>Kardinal im Dienste des einzig wahren Glaubens an Urvan<br>Zur 22. Stunde am 67.Dunkelfrost im Jahre 441   									</td>
